user_story:
  as_a: "someone with lots of ongoing thinking threads"
  i_want: "Cosmo to notice when I keep returning to the same topics"
  so_that: "I become aware of patterns I might not see myself"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given I've mentioned 'dating' in 5+ conversations, when Cosmo notices, then it mentions the pattern"
  - "[ ] Given recurring theme is identified, when Cosmo brings it up, then it feels natural ('I've noticed...')"
  - "[ ] Given pattern is mentioned, when I hear it, then it creates aha moment of self-knowledge"

context:
  why: "Pattern recognition is core self-knowledge value. Users often miss obvious themes in their own thinking."
