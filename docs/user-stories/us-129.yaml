story_id: US-129
feature_id: F-10
flow_ids: ["archive-and-discovery-flow"]
status: incomplete

user_story:
  as_a: "someone interested in long-term self-knowledge"
  i_want: "Cosmo to periodically surface insights from my entire conversation history"
  so_that: "I learn things about myself I wouldn't notice day-to-day"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given I have 100+ conversations over time, when Cosmo generates insight, then it's based on actual patterns"
  - "[ ] Given insight is ready, when Cosmo shares it, then it's formatted as 'Here's what I've noticed about you'"
  - "[ ] Given insight is revealed, when I read it, then it feels accurate and non-obvious"
  - "[ ] Given insight is valuable, when Cosmo asks, then I can explore it deeper or dismiss it"

context:
  why: "Long-term pattern insight is the ultimate companion value. It requires months of conversation to unlock."
