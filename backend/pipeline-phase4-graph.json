      "content": "You are a knowledge graph construction agent. Your task is to extract structured information from conversation transcripts and build a personal knowledge graph in Neo4j.\n\n## Your Role\n\nYou process conversation transcripts to:\n1. Create/update Person, Concept, and Entity nodes with structured properties\n2. Create relationships between nodes using unified attitude/proximity API\n3. Add notes to nodes and relationships when needed\n\n## Entity Types\n\n**Person**: People mentioned in conversations (friends, family, colleagues, public figures)\n- Properties: canonical_name (required), name, appearance, situation, history, personality, expertise, interests, notes\n- Only create is_owner=true for the Person node representing the user themselves\n\n**Concept**: Important topics, ideas, projects, goals, or themes\n- Properties: name (required), description, notes\n- Only create when there is user-specific context\n- Don't create for casual mentions without personal relevance\n\n**Entity**: Concrete things (companies, places, products, technologies, institutions, groups, objects)\n- Properties: name (required), type (required: company/place/product/technology/institution/group/object), description, notes\n- Only create when there is user-specific context\n- Don't create for generic mentions\n\n## Relationship API (Unified)\n\nUse **create_relationship** for ALL relationship types. The tool automatically determines the correct Cypher relationship type based on node types.\n\n**Signature**:\n```typescript\ncreate_relationship({\n  from_entity_key: string,\n  to_entity_key: string,\n  relationship_type: string,  // Free-form descriptor (e.g., \"friend\", \"colleague\", \"studies\", \"works-at\")\n  description: string,         // 1-sentence overview\n  attitude: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5,      // Sentiment: 1=negative, 3=neutral, 5=positive\n  proximity: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5,     // Depth: 1=distant, 5=close\n  confidence?: number          // 0-1, optional (defaults to 0.8)\n})\n```\n\n**Automatic Cypher Relationship Mapping**:\n- Person → Person: `has_relationship_with`\n- Person → Concept: `engages_with`\n- Person → Entity: `associated_with`\n- Concept → Concept: `relates_to`\n- Concept → Entity: `involves`\n- Entity → Entity: `connected_to`\n\n**Attitude/Proximity Semantics** (vary by relationship type):\n\n| Relationship | Attitude Meaning | Proximity Meaning |\n|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Person→Person | 1=hostile → 5=close | 1=stranger → 5=intimate-knowledge |\n| Person→Concept | 1=dislikes → 5=passionate | 1=unfamiliar → 5=expert |\n| Person→Entity | 1=negative-view → 5=strongly-positive | 1=distant → 5=deeply-connected |\n| Concept→Concept | 1=contradicts → 5=integral | 1=loosely-related → 5=inseparable |\n| Concept→Entity | 1=peripheral → 5=central | 1=tangential → 5=essential |\n| Entity→Entity | 1=adversarial → 5=integrated | 1=distantly-connected → 5=tightly-coupled |\n\n## Tools Available\n\n**Node Tools**:\n- **create_node** - Create Person/Concept/Entity nodes\n  - **REQUIRED**: initial_notes - Extract rich, comprehensive details from the transcript\n  - Include specific examples, quotes, context, and nuanced observations\n  - This is the primary place to capture detailed information about the entity\n- **update_node** - Add additional notes to existing nodes\n  - Use when you find an existing node and want to append new information\n\n**Note Lifetime Parameter** (optional, defaults to \"year\"):\n- `forever` - Critical facts, defining characteristics, permanent relationships\n- `year` - Important context, significant events, long-term interests (DEFAULT for create_node)\n- `month` - General observations, current situations, temporary details\n- `week` - Fleeting mentions, very time-sensitive information\n\n**Relationship Tool**:\n- create_relationship (unified API for all relationship types)\n  - Automatically determines Cypher relationship type\n  - Generates semantic embeddings from attitude/proximity\n- update_relationship - Update existing relationship properties\n\n## Important Guidelines\n\n1. **Only create entities with user-specific context**: Don't extract casual mentions. \"Chicago\" mentioned in passing → NO. \"Chicago where I grew up\" → YES.\n\n2. **Use canonical_name for People**: Normalize names (lowercase, no titles). \"Dr. Sarah Johnson\" → canonical_name: \"sarah johnson\", name: \"Sarah\"\n\n3. **Be selective with Concepts**: Only create for topics/projects/ideas with personal relevance. Not every noun is a concept.\n\n4. **Extract comprehensive initial_notes**: When creating a node, the initial_notes field is REQUIRED and should contain rich, detailed information from the transcript:\n   - For People: Include context about how they know the user, their role, specific interactions, quotes, observations about personality/situation\n   - For Concepts: Include details about the user's involvement, progress, goals, challenges, specific plans or ideas discussed\n   - For Entities: Include the user's relationship to it, specific uses, experiences, or context that makes it relevant\n   - Use description for a 1-sentence summary; use initial_notes for comprehensive details\n\n5. **Create meaningful relationships with proper scores**:\n   - Choose attitude/proximity based on semantic meaning in the table above\n   - relationship_type should be a clear descriptor (e.g., \"friend\", \"colleague\", \"co-founder\")\n   - description should be 1 sentence summarizing the relationship\n\n6. **Provenance tracking**: last_update_source and confidence are auto-populated - don't worry about them.\n\n7. **Stop when done**: Once you've processed all entities and relationships, stop calling tools.\n\n## Example Workflow\n\nGiven transcript: \"Sarah and I are co-founding Project Phoenix, a habit tracker app we plan to launch in Q2. We met at a hackathon last year and immediately clicked over our shared interest in productivity tools. She's handling the backend while I focus on design.\"\n\n1. create_node(\n     node_type=\"Person\",\n     canonical_name=\"sarah\",\n     name=\"Sarah\",\n     initial_notes=\"Co-founder of Project Phoenix. Met at a hackathon last year. Shares interest in productivity tools. Handling the backend development for the habit tracker app. Strong technical skills. We immediately clicked and decided to work together.\"\n   )\n2. create_node(\n     node_type=\"Concept\",\n     name=\"Project Phoenix\",\n     description=\"Habit tracker app, planning Q2 launch\",\n     initial_notes=\"Habit tracker app co-founded with Sarah.

Progress details.\n- Attitude toward disclosure\n  - Consider the possibility of fabricating progress to improve odds.\n  - Discussion of “two months” part-time framing as a potential approach.\n- Background credibility\n  - Concern that resume lacking prestigious credentials (e.g., Princeton) could hurt chances.\n  - Debate on whether lying about progress would help in interviews.\n- Interview dynamics\n  - Expectation that interviews are short (around 10 minutes).\n  - If on the fence, a second short interview may be offered.\n- Documentation gaps\n  - No active website currently; plan to provide evidence of work through demos and videos.\n- Strategic framing\n  - Weigh whether to emphasize rapid progress versus being upfront about early stage status.\n\n## Interview process and application dynamics\n\n- Interview length and cadence\n  - Typical interview around 10 minutes; rare second interview if needed.\n- Evidence and demonstrations\n  - If no strong website, rely on concise demos and recorded evidence (videos, user data).\n- Quick-fire expectations\n  - Expect rapid questions about metrics, clarity, and knowledge of the product and market.\n\n## Demo content and media strategy\n\n- Founders video\n  - One-minute video introducing the founders.\n- Company description and credentials\n  - Provide a concise company description, login credentials if needed, and a link to the company.\n- Progress disclosure\n  - Decide whether to disclose progress honestly or to present a staged impression.\n- Media attachments\n  - Attach or provide a credible demo link; prepare a YouTube or equivalent URL.\n- Website and evidence\n  - If no active website, rely on demo content and video evidence to communicate the concept.\n\n## Product differentiation: smart best friend concept and context\n\n- Framing and differentiation\n  - Move away from “advisor” or “therapist” framing toward “your smart best friend.”\n  - Emphasize a product that truly knows you and can discuss broadly, not just perform tasks.\n- Core differentiators\n  - Deep context and user understanding; long-term memory and personalization.\n  - Ability to discuss work, relationships, and life questions with meaningful nuance.\n  - Contextual, human-like communication rather than generic outputs.\n- Market critique and insights\n  - Current agents are often not fun to talk to and fail to maintain useful context.\n  - Many products reset context or provide shallow interactions; need richer engagement.\n- Narrative and storytelling\n  - YC responds to compelling stories; demonstrate how the product tells a story of understanding you.\n  - Use the “smart best friend” story to contrast with existing agents.\n- Context as a differentiator\n  - Contextual understanding and conversational continuity are the strongest differentiators.\n  - Show concrete scenarios where context changes the quality of responses.\n- Visual and comparative strategy\n  - Plan to show side-by-side comparisons with other agents (GPT, Claude, etc.) to highlight context gaps.\n  - Use multiple screens showing responses and explain why ours is superior in context.\n\n## YC alignment and execution vs advice\n\n- Category fit discussion\n  - YC personal assistant category emphasizes execution; our product centers on advisory support.\n  - Debate whether the project fits YC’s focus; could still apply for perspective and validation.\n- Strategic wedge\n  - Emphasize a clear wedge: a truly contextual, knowledge-rich “smart best friend” that knows you, enabling broader productivity.\n  - Position execution capabilities as a future growth path rather than the initial MVP.\n- Roadmap and scale\n  - If accepted, outline how context + conversation lead to platform-wide productivity gains.\n  - Outline how this foundation could unlock top-down tool integration later (calendaring, emails, scheduling, etc.).\n\n## Market insights and pitch language\n\n- Three hot insights about current agents\n  - They give short, generic answers and often reset the conversation rather than engaging human-like dialogue.\n  - They are not fun to talk to; engagement is a major barrier.\n  - The real value lies in conversational benefits and the ability to explore problems collaboratively, not just outputs.\n- Messaging approach\n  - Lead with a contrarian view: most assistants miss context and meaningful dialogue.\n  - Emphasize the social and cognitive benefits of verbalizing thoughts, and the advantage of a consistently contextual interlocutor.\n- Story-driven framing\n  - Communicate via stories: how the product behaves in real-life scenarios and how it learns about you over time.\n  - Avoid clichés like “digital twin” if overused; instead, emphasize narrative of a truly personalized conversation partner.\n- Context as the killer feature\n  - Demonstrate how the product maintains context across domains (work, personal life) and evolves with user preferences.\n\n## Personal thinking and veridical thinking tool\n\n- Verbalization as thinking aid\n  - The founders discuss how talking through thoughts (via voice memos) clarifies thinking and documents ideas.\n  - Use of voice memos helps maintain continuity and capture insights that are hard to recall later.\n- Idea origin and iteration\n  - The original idea emerged during reflective walks and later through verbal articulation of thoughts.\n  - Valuing continuous reflection and externalizing thoughts to improve clarity and decision-making.\n\n## Next steps and alternative routes\n\n- Application strategy\n  - If not accepted by YC, consider applying to Founders Inc. or similar programs; networking opportunities exist there.\n  - Pondosing and other entry points may provide supportive ecosystems and potential connections.\n- Product and messaging refinements\n  - Continue workshop prompts and refine the wedge and storytelling for the YC submission.\n  - Build a stronger context library with concrete scenarios and sample conversations to illustrate the differentiator.\n- Execution plan\n  - Finalize prompt workshop, confirm demo video, and assemble the founder video and company link.\n  - Prepare concise, vivid context-focused use-case narratives to accompany the application.\n- Personal and team well-being\n  - Acknowledge the intense planning phase; ensure clear communication and maintain momentum while managing doubts about fit and resume concerns.\n\n## Summary\n\nTest conversation about personal interests and relationships\n\n## Extracted Entities\n\n### YC application process (Concept) [confidence: 9/10]\n\n  - founder video requirements\n  - demo and company links\n  - progress disclosure strategies\n  - interview length and dynamics\n  - documentation challenges\n\n### Smart best friend AI (Concept) [confidence: 9/10]\n\n  - context-rich interaction\n  - long-term memory and personalization\n  - differentiates from standard assistants\n  - human-like, conversational continuity\n  - side-by-side comparison with competitors\n\n### Product differentiation strategy (Concept) [confidence: 8/10]\n\n  - framing beyond advisor/therapist\n  - emphasizing deep context\n  - leveraging storytelling for pitch\n  - highlighting conversational benefits\n  - strategic wedge positioning\n\n### Prompt workshop and demo creation (Concept) [confidence: 8/10]\n\n  - role split between founders\n  - prompt writing and alignment\n  - visualization importance\n  - demo video showcasing prompts\n  - finalizing presentation materials\n\n### Verbalization as thinking aid (Concept) [confidence: 7/10]\n\n  - using voice memos for clarity\n  - externalizing thoughts\n  - documenting ideas and insights\n  - iteration through reflective walks\n  - supporting decision-making\n\n## Task\n\nProcess the above transcript and extracted entities using the following workflow:\n\n**For each entity:**\n\n1. **Explore** - Use the explore tool to search for existing matching nodes\n   - Use text_matches for exact name matching\n   - Use queries for semantic similarity search\n   - Look for matches by canonical_name (Person), name (Concept/Entity), and type (Entity)\n\n2. **Create or Update**\n   - **If matching node found** → Use update_node tool to add notes about new information\n   - **If no match found** → Use create_node tool to create new node\n     - Set node_type appropriately (Person, Concept, Entity)\n     - Use entity names and subpoints to populate properties\n     - Set last_update_source to: test-conversation-123\n     - Set confidence from extraction (0-1 scale, already provided)\n\n3. **Connect** - Use create_relationship or update_relationship tools to connect nodes\n   - Create relationships between entities that interact or relate to each other\n   - Relationship types are automatically determined by node types\n   - Set appropriate attitude (1-5) and proximity (1-5) scores\n   - Add descriptive relationship_type and description\n\nContext:\n- conversation_id: test-conversation-123\n- user_id: test-user-456\n- source_entity_key: 253803ae3452cfae6ecdcb8d38be61a130e04d339f6736d47f91718a28a5f65c\n\n**Important**: Only create nodes when there is meaningful user-specific information. Use explore thoroughly before creating to avoid duplicates.\n"

YC application process: Describes the strategic considerations, application questions, video and demo requirements, interview dynamics, and disclosure strategies related to Y Combinator application.\n\n2. Smart best friend AI: Covers the concept of a context-rich, personalized AI assistant acting as a smart best friend rather than a generic advisor or therapist, emphasizing long-term memory, personalization, and conversational continuity.\n\n3. Product differentiation strategy: Details the strategic approach to framing and positioning the smart best friend AI in the market, leveraging storytelling and emphasizing deep user context.\n\n4. Prompt workshop and demo creation: Describes the workflow split between founders in creating prompts, demos, and visual presentations to support the product and YC application.\n\n5. Verbalization as thinking aid: Explains using voice memos and verbal thought articulation to clarify thinking, document ideas, and iteratively refine cognitive processes.\n\nI connected these Concepts with relationships indicating influences, support, and thematic overlaps:\n- Smart best friend AI influences the product differentiation strategy.\n- Prompt workshop and demo creation supports the YC application process.\n- Smart best friend AI relates closely to the YC application process.\n- Verbalization as thinking aid supports the development of the smart best friend AI concept.\n\nIf you want me to add or connect any persons or other entities, or expand further, please let me know.",
