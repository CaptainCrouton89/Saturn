# The Technical Vision

| Human Cognition | AI Agent Equivalent |
|---|---|
| Knowledge of world | Pretraining |
| Episodic memory | Sources (conversation transcripts) |
| Semantic learned memory | Entities (People, Concepts, Relationships) |

## What to Ingest

- Emails: it needs to internalize some of it, not just be able to search on command? Or maybe it's just incorporated into it's search/explore/traverse tool?
- Internet: It reads the news—it's aware of what's going on, and adds it to memory. Gets added as mostly semantic memories of entities.
  - News gets parsed. Saved as facts about world, has it's own phase0 version
  - New semantic ideas added, different pipeline (not user sourced)
- Slack channels

## Why Our Search is Better

- MemCell: Struggles for ingesting larges bits of data, fails to get big picture.
