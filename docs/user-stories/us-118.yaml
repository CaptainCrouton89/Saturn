title: Voice Recognition Works with Background Noise
story_id: US-118
feature_id: F-07
flow_ids: ["entertaining-chat-flow", "brainstorm-chat-flow"]
status: incomplete

user_story:
  as_a: "someone in noisy environments (street, coffee shop, gym)"
  i_want: "voice transcription to work reasonably well even with background sound"
  so_that: "I can talk to Cosmo while walking or exercising without perfect silence"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given I'm on a noisy street, when I speak, then system captures my voice and ignores background"
  - "[ ] Given audio is unclear, when transcription completes, then accuracy is at least 85% for natural speech"
  - "[ ] Given transcription has errors, when I notice and correct it, then system learns for future"

context:
  why: "Conversations happen in real life, not in quiet rooms. Robustness is critical."
