title: Onboarding & First Conversation
flow_id: onboarding-flow
feature_ids: ["F-01", "F-02"]
story_ids: []

key_personas:
  - Solo founder/remote worker
  - Person in transition
  - Introvert without conversational outlets

description: |
  Minimal onboarding to get users into natural conversation as quickly as possible.
  Core principle: Learn by doing, not by tutorial.

primary_flows:
  - name: "Initial App Setup"
    trigger: "User downloads Cosmo app, opens for first time"
    steps:
      - "App explains core concept in 1-2 sentences: 'I ask questions, you think out loud'"
      - "Permission requests (microphone, notifications, cloud sync)"
      - "Quick intro: 'What's your name?'"
      - "1-2 open questions: 'What's been on your mind lately?' or 'What are you interested in?'"
      - "No tutorial, no mode selection, no feature walkthrough"
    outcome: "User ready for first real conversation with minimal friction"
    duration: "~2 minutes"
    edge_cases: |
      - User skips optional questions → proceed to conversation anyway
      - User gives very brief answers → system adapts, learns organically over time

  - name: "First Conversation"
    trigger: "Immediately after onboarding setup"
    steps:
      - "Transition seamlessly from onboarding into first conversation"
      - "Microphone ready, blank slate"
      - "User speaks first about whatever is on their mind"
      - "Cosmo responds with natural questions (informed by minimal onboarding context)"
      - "First few exchanges may be exploratory as system learns user's style"
      - "Conversation continues naturally until user stops speaking (3-5 min timeout)"
    outcome: "User completes first conversation, experiences core value proposition"
    duration: "10-20 minutes (varies by user)"
    edge_cases: |
      - User gives very short responses → Cosmo keeps questions open and exploratory
      - User corrects Cosmo about something → conversation continues naturally, system learns
      - User pauses for extended period → conversation auto-ends, saves progress

post_conversation:
  - name: "First Conversation Complete"
    trigger: "Conversation ends (timeout or user closes app)"
    steps:
      - "No prompts about synthesis or next steps"
      - "Conversation saved automatically"
      - "Background: Entity extraction begins (batch processing)"
      - "Graph updated with initial entities (people, projects, topics mentioned)"
      - "User can return anytime, no scheduled follow-up"
    outcome: "User's first conversation archived, graph begins building"

technical_notes: |
  - Onboarding context stored minimally: name + 1-2 initial data points
  - First conversation has almost no prior context (cold start)
  - System relies on LLM conversational intelligence, not rigid onboarding script
  - After first conversation: batch entity extraction populates Neo4j graph
  - Subsequent conversations will have richer context to draw from

ux_considerations:
  - No tutorial screens or feature tours
  - No "example conversation" demos
  - Jump straight to real conversation after basic setup
  - Real-time transcript visible (live captions style)
  - User sees their speech + Cosmo's text responses
  - Audio TTS for Cosmo's responses (can be read while also hearing)
