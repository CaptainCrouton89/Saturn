story_id: US-128
feature_id: F-10
flow_ids: ["therapy-chat-flow"]
status: incomplete

user_story:
  as_a: "someone who sometimes acts against my stated values"
  i_want: "Cosmo to gently notice when my behavior contradicts what I say I want"
  so_that: "I can address the disconnect and make intentional choices"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given I say 'I want someone independent' but repeatedly date very available people, when pattern is clear, then Cosmo notices"
  - "[ ] Given contradiction is clear, when Cosmo brings it up, then it does so gently ('I've noticed...')"
  - "[ ] Given observation is made, when I hear it, then it opens up deeper reflection"
  - "[ ] Given I'm not ready to hear it, when I deflect, then Cosmo respects and doesn't push"

context:
  why: "Compassionate contradiction-pointing is therapeutic and leads to growth. It's a sign of genuine care."
