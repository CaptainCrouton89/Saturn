status: incomplete

user_story:
  as_a: "someone trying to think through a problem"
  i_want: "Cosmo to ask questions that help me reach my own conclusions"
  so_that: "I gain insights and clarity through guided self-reflection, not advice"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given I state a problem, when Cosmo responds, then it asks clarifying questions rather than giving advice"
  - "[ ] Given I answer a question, when Cosmo responds next, then follow-up questions are natural and build on what I said"
  - "[ ] Given I'm thinking through something, when Cosmo speaks, then responses sound like a curious friend, not a therapist"
  - "[ ] Given conversation continues, when Cosmo speaks, then questions use natural language (incomplete sentences, casual tone)"
  - "[ ] Given I've been talking for a while, when Cosmo asks next question, then it addresses the core issue, not tangents"

context:
  why: "Socratic questioning is Cosmo's core differentiator. Questions must feel authentic, not scripted."
