status: incomplete

user_story:
  as_a: "someone who wants to talk but doesn't know what about"
  i_want: "to see 2-3 suggested conversation topics based on my recent life"
  so_that: "I don't have to think about what to discuss - Cosmo does the work"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given I'm starting a conversation, when the app loads, then I see 2-3 relevant topic suggestions"
  - "[ ] Given I have past conversations, when topics are suggested, then they relate to active themes (recent topics, unresolved threads)"
  - "[ ] Given I'm a new user, when topics are suggested, then they're based on onboarding profile answers"
  - "[ ] Given topics are shown, when I don't like any, then I can type/speak a different topic"
  - "[ ] Given topics are shown, when I say/tap 'surprise me', then Cosmo picks one topic to explore"

context:
  why: "Most users want to talk but lack direction. Cosmo's 'Conversation DJ' role is to suggest what to discuss."
