title: System Avoids Repeated Bad Questions
story_id: US-125
feature_id: F-06
flow_ids: ["therapy-chat-flow"]
status: incomplete

user_story:
  as_a: "someone who's been frustrated by a bad question"
  i_want: "Cosmo to remember when I didn't like a question and never ask it again"
  so_that: "I trust Cosmo not to repeat mistakes"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given Cosmo asks a question I dislike (I respond with frustration), when this happens, then system flags it"
  - "[ ] Given question was poorly received, when similar question comes up again, then system skips it"
  - "[ ] Given I snap 'obviously' at a question, when this is consistent, then system learns not to ask obvious questions"
  - "[ ] Given Cosmo made error, when next conversation happens, then the error type is avoided"

context:
  why: "Recovery from mistakes builds trust. Remembering failures is as important as learning successes."
