acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given I'm in a conversation, when I ask 'what did I say about X?', then system searches archive and returns relevant excerpts"
  - "[ ] Given I open archive tab, when I type a keyword, then search results appear with matching conversations"
  - "[ ] Given I search, when results show, then they're sorted by relevance (most relevant first)"
  - "[ ] Given search results appear, when I tap a result, then I see the full conversation and can continue discussing the topic"

context:
  why: "Search enables the 'life archive' value prop. Users can learn from and build on past thinking."
