title: User Reads Text Responses When Audio Inappropriate
story_id: US-117
feature_id: F-07
flow_ids: ["entertaining-chat-flow", "brainstorm-chat-flow"]
status: incomplete

user_story:
  as_a: "someone in a meeting or silent environment"
  i_want: "to have conversations by reading and typing instead of speaking"
  so_that: "I can use Cosmo even when audio isn't appropriate"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given I'm in conversation, when I want to type instead of speak, then I can toggle to text mode"
  - "[ ] Given I'm in text mode, when Cosmo responds, then it displays text instead of playing audio"
  - "[ ] Given I prefer reading, when I tap text responses, then they appear in full without needing to listen"
  - "[ ] Given I switch to text mode, when I complete conversation, then archive preserves my preference"

context:
  why: "Not all contexts allow audio. Text fallback ensures Cosmo works everywhere."
