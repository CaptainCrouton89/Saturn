user_story:
  as_a: "someone with varying emotional energy"
  i_want: "Cosmo to know when to probe deeply and when to keep things light"
  so_that: "conversations feel natural and don't push me when I'm not ready"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given I give short responses, when Cosmo asks next question, then questions are simpler and more open-ended"
  - "[ ] Given I'm providing detailed answers, when Cosmo asks next question, then it can probe more deeply"
  - "[ ] Given I signal exhaustion ('I don't know', long pauses), when Cosmo responds, then it eases off and suggests wrapping up or changing topic"
  - "[ ] Given I'm energized and engaged, when Cosmo asks next question, then it can explore complexity and nuance"

context:
  why: "Conversation quality depends on reading energy and emotional readiness. Pushing too hard breaks trust."
