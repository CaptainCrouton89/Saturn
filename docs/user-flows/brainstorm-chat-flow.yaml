feature_ids: ["F-01", "F-03", "F-05", "F-07"]
story_ids: []

key_personas:
  - Solo founder/remote worker
  - Creative professional
  - Anyone working through ideas verbally

primary_flows:
  - name: "Blog Post Ideation"
    trigger: "User mentions idea they want to write about / Cosmo suggests working on draft"
    steps:
      - "Cosmo: 'Let's work on that blog post you mentioned. What's the core idea?'"
      - "User starts talking through what they want to say"
      - "Cosmo asks clarifying questions: What's the insight? Who's it for? Why does it matter?"
      - "Questions pull out nuance user didn't articulate in initial thought"
      - "Conversation naturally organizes the post structure"
      - "After 15-20 min, Cosmo: 'Want me to draft this into a post?'"
      - "User confirms and can immediately see structured draft"
    outcome: "Draft blog post ready for editing (skips blank page problem)"
    edge_cases: |
      - User realizes mid-conversation idea isn't ready → pivot to different topic
      - User wants to record for later → just archive, no synthesis

  - name: "Startup/Product Ideation"
    trigger: "User mentions business idea or product concept"
    steps:
      - "Cosmo asks: What problem does this solve? Who has it? Why you?"
      - "Questions help refine: target market, core value prop, competitive advantage"
      - "User articulates pitch through natural conversation"
      - "Cosmo connects to past ideas/knowledge user has shared"
      - "Questions surface: What's the first step? What's risky? What excites you?"
      - "Post-conversation, Cosmo offers: 'Turn this into a project plan / product spec / pitch deck outline?'"
    outcome: "Clear articulation of idea + actionable plan"
    edge_cases: "User has multiple ideas → Cosmo helps prioritize which to develop"

  - name: "Technical Problem Solving"
    trigger: "User stuck on technical challenge, uses Cosmo to think through it"
    steps:
      - "User describes problem (not asking for solution, just thinking out loud)"
      - "Cosmo asks: What have you tried? What's the constraint? What would ideal look like?"
      - "User talks through different approaches"
      - "Cosmo asks about trade-offs and implications"
      - "By talking it through, user often solves it themselves"
      - "If not, conversation clarifies what research/help is needed"
    outcome: "Solution found or path to solution clarity"
    edge_cases: "User wants to capture technical discussion → synthesize to spec doc"

  - name: "Project Planning"
    trigger: "User mentions new project/initiative to work on"
    steps:
      - "Cosmo: 'Let's break this down. What are the phases?'"
      - "Questions help surface: dependencies, timeline, resources, success metrics"
      - "Conversation naturally creates project structure"
      - "User articulates plan by talking through details"
      - "Cosmo: 'Should I turn this into a project plan?'"
    outcome: "Structured project plan extracted from conversation"
    edge_cases: "Project too large → Cosmo breaks into phases to plan one at a time"

secondary_flows:
  - name: "Writer's Block Breakthrough"
    trigger: "User stuck on writing, wants to talk through it"
    steps:
      - "Cosmo: 'Tell me what you're trying to say like you're talking to a friend'"
      - "User speaks naturally instead of writing"
      - "Cosmo asks for clarity/expansion on key points"
      - "Conversation becomes the draft"
    outcome: "Rough draft from spoken thinking"
