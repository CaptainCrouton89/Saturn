flow_ids: ["onboarding-flow", "therapy-chat-flow", "entertaining-chat-flow"]
status: incomplete

user_story:
  as_a: "someone during dead time (walking, lying in bed, commuting)"
  i_want: "to speak naturally and hear Cosmo respond via voice without reading text"
  so_that: "I can have conversations hands-free and eyes-free"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given I'm in a conversation, when I speak my response, then system transcribes my speech accurately"
  - "[ ] Given Cosmo generates a response, when it does, then it speaks naturally with good voice synthesis"
  - "[ ] Given I'm in noisy environment, when I speak, then system handles background noise reasonably"
  - "[ ] Given system makes transcription error, when I notice, then I can correct it and system learns"
  - "[ ] Given conversation is in progress, when I want to read Cosmo's response instead, then text is available"

context:
  why: "Voice-first is essential for dead time engagement. This is a core differentiator vs. text-based AI."
