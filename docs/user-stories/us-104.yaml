user_story:
  as_a: "someone ready to start thinking about a topic"
  i_want: "to select a suggested topic or provide my own, then immediately begin conversation"
  so_that: "the conversation flows naturally without delays"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given I see topic suggestions, when I tap one, then Cosmo opens with a warm greeting about that topic"
  - "[ ] Given I provide a custom topic, when I submit it, then Cosmo acknowledges it and begins asking clarifying questions"
  - "[ ] Given conversation is starting, when Cosmo speaks, then greeting is warm and natural (not robotic)"
  - "[ ] Given I'm a returning user, when Cosmo opens, then it references relevant past conversations if applicable"

context:
  why: "The first 30 seconds determine engagement. Natural, warm opening is critical."
