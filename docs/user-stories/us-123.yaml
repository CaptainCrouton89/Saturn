  - "[ ] Given I select a conversation, when I choose export, then options include PDF, markdown, plaintext"
  - "[ ] Given I export to PDF, when the file generates, then it's formatted nicely with metadata"
  - "[ ] Given I export to markdown, when it creates a file, then it can be used in notes apps or published"
  - "[ ] Given export is ready, when I see it, then I can email, save, or share it"
