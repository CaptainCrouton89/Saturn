feature_id: F-06
flow_ids: ["therapy-chat-flow", "entertaining-chat-flow"]
status: incomplete

user_story:
  as_a: "someone with specific preferences for how I like to be questioned"
  i_want: "Cosmo to learn what questions I find engaging and which ones annoy me"
  so_that: "conversations improve over time as Cosmo adapts to my style"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given I have multiple conversations, when I react positively to certain questions, then system notices"
  - "[ ] Given I'm engaged when Cosmo asks open-ended questions, when system learns this, then it asks more open questions"
  - "[ ] Given I disengage at certain question types, when this is consistent, then system avoids those patterns"
  - "[ ] Given Cosmo has been tracking preferences for weeks, when I have new conversation, then question style feels more tailored"

context:
  why: "Learning makes Cosmo a better conversation partner over time. It's the difference between chatbot and companion."
