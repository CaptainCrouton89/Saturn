title: System Adapts Question Style Over Time
story_id: US-126
feature_id: F-06
flow_ids: ["therapy-chat-flow", "brainstorm-chat-flow"]
status: incomplete

user_story:
  as_a: "someone whose preferences might evolve"
  i_want: "Cosmo to adapt its question style as my communication preferences change"
  so_that: "conversations stay fresh and feel responsive to who I am now"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given I've had 50+ conversations over months, when new conversations start, then question style reflects latest patterns"
  - "[ ] Given my preferences shift (e.g., moving from deep therapy talk to brainstorming), when I start new topic, then questions adapt"
  - "[ ] Given I explicitly say 'more casual please', when I do, then Cosmo adjusts immediately"

context:
  why: "People change. A good companion evolves with you, not stays static."
