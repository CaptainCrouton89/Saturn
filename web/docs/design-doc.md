Design Philosophy

Cosmo's landing page embodies the product's core promise: "This is like 
talking to your smart best friend that you go to for advice." The design
should feel warm, grounded, and human—not like another glossy tech product,
but like entering a space where real conversation happens.

The aesthetic draws from therapeutic serenity (earthy neutrals, organic
shapes, generous spacing) while maintaining enough structure to convey
technical credibility. We're building trust through warmth rather than
corporate polish. The page uses concept-first storytelling: acknowledge the
crowded "AI companion" space, cut through the noise with clear
differentiation (smart + knows you + fun to talk to), then demonstrate
through concrete examples of complex life situations where Cosmo shines.

Visual elements include a beautiful knowledge graph visualization showing
how Cosmo builds understanding over time, making the technical architecture
tangible and impressive without being sterile.

Page Content Structure

1. Hero

Headline: "Your smart best friend. Always there to think things through."

Subheadline: "Cosmo is the AI companion that actually knows you—and that
you actually enjoy talking to."

CTA: Email input + "Join Waitlist" button

---
2. Problem Recognition

Section headline: "You've seen the AI therapist. You've seen the AI coach."

Body: Brief paragraph acknowledging the crowded space and why existing
solutions fall flat (they talk like bad essay writers, they're not fun to
talk to, they don't remember context).

---
3. The Differentiator

Section headline: "Why do you go to a specific friend for advice?"

Three criteria (icon + title + description):
1. They're smart - They give you real insight, not generic platitudes
2. They know you - No need to re-explain your entire life situation every
time
3. You like talking to them - The conversation itself is engaging, not a
chore

Body: "Most AI companions nail #1, vaguely gesture at #2, and completely
miss #3. Cosmo is built for all three."

---
4. Use Case Examples

Section headline: "Real life is complicated. Cosmo gets it."

Cards (3-4 examples):
- Work Drama: "Should I escalate this conflict with my manager or wait
until after Q1 reviews?" - Shows Cosmo remembering your promotion timeline,
manager's communication style, past work dynamics
- Relationship Decision: "My ex just joined my company. Do I take the
role?" - Demonstrates handling nuanced emotional + practical considerations
with deep context
- Career Transition: "I'm thinking about leaving my stable job to start
something" - Shows Cosmo remembering your stated values, past conversations
about risk tolerance, financial situation
- Creative Block: "I can't figure out why this project feels stuck" -
Probing questions that help you surface your own insights

Each card shows a snippet of realistic conversation.

---
5. How It Works

Section headline: "Built on memory, not just models"

Flow (3 steps):
1. You talk - Open the app, start speaking. No setup, no prompts.
2. Cosmo asks questions - Drawing on everything it knows about your life to
ask the right things.
3. Clarity emerges - Through conversation, not through generic advice.

---
6. Knowledge Graph Visualization

Section headline: "It builds a living map of your life"

Visual: Beautiful animated graph showing nodes (People, Projects, Ideas,
Topics) and relationships

Explanation: "Cosmo remembers the people in your life, your ongoing
projects, recurring themes, and how they all connect. Every conversation
makes it smarter about you."

---
7. Final CTA

Headline: "Stop scrolling. Start thinking."

Subheadline: "Join the waitlist for early access."

Form: Email + submit button

Optional social proof: "Join [X] others" or testimonial quotes (if
available)
