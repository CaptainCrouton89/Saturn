# YC App Prep Notes

Founders discuss task division for building an app, YC application strategy, differentiation, demo plan, and next steps. They consider honesty about progress, and frame a "smart best friend" narrative to stand out.

## Task division and initial plan

- Task division for the app
  - Write and workshop prompts; align on the prompt; then write the prompt.
- Demo video creation
  - Create the demo video for the prompt.
- Visualization responsibilities
  - Handle the visualization of the demo.
- Importance of visualization
  - Initially questioned; concluded it’s important to show technical skill and how it works, though it should be balanced with time.

## YC app questions and progress honesty

- Questions to address
  - Founder video (one minute), demo attachment, describe your company, credentials, how far along you are.
- Honesty about progress
  - Considered fabricating progress; discussed lying about stage (e.g., “two months part-time”); worried about resume gaps (e.g., Princeton) and how that might affect eligibility; debated frank vs. embellished claims; aimed to be frank about early stage while signaling positive traction.

## Interview process and evidence

- Interview length and rounds
  - Typical interview is about 10 minutes; a second interview possible if on the fence.
- Evidence and validation
  - Considered needing concrete users or data; discussed “bible that shit” as evidence; contemplated showing proof of users and traction; discussed having a “vibe code” or similar shorthand for evidence.

## Demo content and application fields

- Founder video and demo requirements
  - One-minute founder video; not necessarily the demo; if a demo exists, attach it (likely YouTube URL).
- Company details and credentials
  - Company link, description, a short 50-character blurb; login credentials if applicable.
- Website and assets
  - No active website; focus on the demo and narrative; website style decisions to be addressed later.

## Product positioning and differentiation

- Core idea
  - Position as a “smart best friend” rather than a traditional advisor; emphasis on deep context and memory.
- Framing and storytelling
  - YC favors compelling narratives; avoid overused concepts like “digital twin”; tell stories that illustrate real problems and solutions.
- Key differentiators
  - The product knows you and can converse naturally; it can recall long-term context; it avoids generic, impersonal responses; aim to show tangible, context-aware reasoning.

## Use cases and demo strategy

- Use cases to demonstrate
  - Work problems, personal issues, brainstorming, planning, scheduling, drafting communications.
- Context and memory
  - Strong emphasis on long-term memory and context to avoid repetitive explanations.
- Demo approach
  - Compare against multiple agents (GPT, Kin, Replica) to highlight weaknesses; show own agent’s contextual understanding; present multiple screens and side-by-side responses; then demonstrate superior context-aware outputs.

## Market insights and messaging

- Insights about current agents
  - Common failures: short, non-contextual answers; lack of engaging conversation; missing broader external context.
- Framing and differentiation
  - Build a narrative around being the “smart best friend” who truly knows you; emphasize context and conversation quality; craft a wedge that signals a path to large-scale productivity.

## Recording and iteration

- Documentation of the session
  - Acknowledged that the discussion was being recorded for future reference and refinement.

## Idea origin and reflection

- Origin of the idea
  - Idea sparked after walking back from a conversation and voicing thoughts; initial notion to turn voice memos into an app.
- Value of verbalization
  - Belief that talking thoughts aloud improves thinking, documentation, and insight; saw voice memos as a productive tool for capturing and clarifying ideas.

## Next steps and opportunities

- Accelerator and outreach
  - Plan to apply to Founders Inc; explore other accelerators; network and seek feedback; continue to develop the concept and gather context/examples.
- Execution plan and wedge development
  - Decide on a clear wedge and a plausible path to a large company; focus on how the product becomes a massive productivity boost by being the memory and context engine for all tools.

## Personal and logistical notes

- Hydration and breaks
  - Mentioned needing water; coffee and tea could follow.
- Off-topic tangents
  - Included light conversations about skating, weather, and casual banter; used to maintain energy and rapport during the discussion.
