story_id: US-112
feature_id: F-05
flow_ids: ["onboarding-flow", "brainstorm-chat-flow"]
status: incomplete

user_story:
  as_a: "someone who just had a productive conversation"
  i_want: "to be asked if I want to turn my transcript into a structured artifact"
  so_that: "I can capture the value without having to write from scratch"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given a conversation concludes, when it ends, then Cosmo asks 'Want me to turn this into something?' with options"
  - "[ ] Given options are shown, when I see them, then choices are relevant to the conversation (blog post, plan, notes, decision framework)"
  - "[ ] Given I select an option, when I do, then Cosmo generates a draft immediately"
  - "[ ] Given draft is shown, when I see it, then it's organized and readable (not just raw transcript)"
  - "[ ] Given I don't want synthesis, when I decline, then conversation just archives without judgment"

context:
  why: "Synthesis transforms talking from recreational to productive. It's the multiplier that creates real output."
