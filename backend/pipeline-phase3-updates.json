They debated the tone of progress disclosure, balancing transparency with potential embellishment, considering whether to honestly present as early-stage or part-time contributors with around two months of progress. They also expressed concern about the impact of lacking prestigious resume signals such as Princeton or Harvard credentials, weighing how to rationalize or present stronger signals to strengthen their application's appeal. The preparation includes aligning on honest messaging that showcases their unique approach without overhyping, and incorporating a founder video and other multimedia elements to enhance the submission's effectiveness.",
