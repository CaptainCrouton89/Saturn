primary_flows:
  - name: "Bedtime Processing Session"
    trigger: "User notices evening feeling scattered, taps Cosmo or receives suggestion"
    steps:
      - "System detects recent conversation pattern (e.g., work stress, relationship questions) from history"
      - "Cosmo: 'Hey, noticed work stuff seems heavy this week. Want to talk about it?'"
      - "User confirms or suggests different topic"
      - "Cosmo uses Socratic questioning to help user articulate the core issue"
      - "Questions naturally lead to: What's really bothering you? What would ideal look like? What's in your control?"
      - "User has aha moments and articulates clarity they didn't have before"
      - "Conversation winds down naturally as user feels processed"
    outcome: "User feels heard, has clarity on next steps, goes to bed calmer"
    edge_cases: |
      - User gets frustrated with a question → Cosmo acknowledges and pivots
      - User reveals something new (first time discussing topic) → system builds context
      - User says something contradictory → Cosmo gently notes without judgment

  - name: "Big Decision Processing"
    trigger: "User mentions major decision (career change, relationship, relocation)"
    steps:
      - "Cosmo recognizes decision context and adjusts depth of questioning"
      - "Questions help surface: underlying fears, values alignment, alternatives considered"
      - "Cosmo brings up relevant past conversations if applicable"
      - "User talks through options, constraints, what success looks like"
      - "No advice given - only clarifying questions"
      - "By end, user has clarity on decision or acceptance of uncertainty"
    outcome: "User feels supported in decision-making process"
    edge_cases: "User needs time to sit with it → Cosmo respects pace, doesn't push"

  - name: "Pattern Recognition & Insight"
    trigger: "System detects recurring theme across conversations (e.g., 'You've mentioned this 3 times')"
    steps:
      - "Cosmo brings it up naturally: 'Been noticing [pattern] come up. What's that about?'"
      - "User either confirms awareness or discovers new self-knowledge"
      - "Deeper exploration of why pattern exists"
      - "User gains insight into behavior/values they weren't aware of"
    outcome: "Increased self-knowledge, pattern visibility, behavior understanding"
    edge_cases: "User not ready to hear observation → Cosmo backs off, no judgment"

secondary_flows:
  - name: "Grief/Loss Processing"
    trigger: "User mentions loss (breakup, job loss, relocation)"
    steps:
      - "Cosmo creates safe space for processing"
      - "Validates emotion without trying to fix it"
      - "Asks questions about: what was meaningful, what's being grieved, next chapter"
    outcome: "Emotional release, acceptance, forward movement"
