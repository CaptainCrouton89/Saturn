status: incomplete

user_story:
  as_a: "someone with hundreds of conversations"
  i_want: "to quickly search for past conversations by keyword or topic"
  so_that: "I can find old thinking without scrolling through everything"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "[ ] Given I open Archive, when I enter a search term, then results show matching conversations within 2 seconds"
  - "[ ] Given results appear, when I see them, then they're sorted by relevance (most recent first, or most relevant)"
  - "[ ] Given I search for vague term, when results show, then semantic search helps (not just keyword match)"
  - "[ ] Given results are shown, when I tap one, then I see the full transcript with search term highlighted"

context:
  why: "Archive search is foundational to the 'life archive' value prop. Makes past thinking accessible."
